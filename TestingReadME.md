Testing Instructions
Welcome to the MorSwap testing page. Follow these instructions to test the swap functionality:

Thank you so much for testing. Please note that although this is testing site, and I have done everything I can 
to make sure you are unable to connect to any Main networks. 
Please take a moment to ensure you are using the Arbitrum Sepolia network. 
You can check this by clicking the network name at the top of the page. 
And while this is a testing site, please be aware that there are still risks involved with
 loss of testnet funds. *Please double check every transaction through metamask and the browser console*.

Connect your wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button on the top right corner.
Ensure you have some testnet (MOR, ETH) in your wallet. if you don't saMOR can be found at MorFaucet.xyz  
And saETH can be found at faucets.chain.link/sepolia  This is my favorite faucet.

Before you Swap, For right now, you must first wrap your ETH into the mockWETH that I created. 
You can do this with the buttons Wrap and Unwrap on the Morswap Testing instructions page. 
This will Wrap/Unwrap any desired amount of ETH/WETH at a time, Uniswap does take care of this though Multi-Hop Swaps which I plan to incorporate very soon. 

The address for my mockWETH is 0x9F220B916edDcD745F9547f2D5cd5D06F40d1B6E Please add this token to your wallet

Please be aware due to a lack of funds the pool has very low liquidity, so please try and swap small 
amounts such as 0.0001 MOR and 0.000001 WETH. 
Alternitively if you would like to donate some funds to the pool After wrapping some ETH on the testing page, you can do so by clicking add Liqudity. This will add a fixed 1000 MOR to 1 WETH ratio to the pool

Enter the amount you want to swap Within the Top input field.

Click the "Swap" button to execute the swap.

Review the transaction and Sign.

Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
Wait for the transaction to be processed and check your wallet for the swapped tokens.
